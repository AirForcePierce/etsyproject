Complete with green naugahyde perforated seat covers and works extremely well being fully adjustable.  It tilts from the shoulder plate.  It has never been cleaned or touched up, the residual marks and scuffs add to the character of its patina.  \n\nThere are remnants of the original labels underneath the chair and one is stamped 1955 which I believe is the manufacture date of this chair.  The metal underneath the seat is marked patent number 123496 which is the patent  number for the chair base registered by George C. Brainard.\n\nThis item would be a great addition to an office or a shop. \n\n***This is a large piece which is pick up only or you can arrange for your own courier service after payment***\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nThe chair measures 30&quot; tall (19&quot; to seat height) 15.25&quot; wide by 14.25&quot; deep.\n\nCONDITION\n\nIn good condition but has scratches commensurate with age to the green pint on the metal base - please see all pictures as they form part of the description\n\nIf you have questions or would like to see other angles of the item, please Convo me and I will happily provide more info.\n\nShop Ref: Box \n\nGENERAL\n\nI am honest in my descriptions and always point out any flaws to avoid disappointment. Any questions will be answered as quickly as possible. If I have made a mistake in my description I am always happy to rectify this. \n\nSHIPPING\n\nI combine postage where possible and purchasing several items at once could lower your postage cost significantly. I will always refund postage and packaging that was overpaid by more than $1.\n\n*******THANKS FOR VISITING YESTERYEAR ESSENTIALS :)*******\n\nIf you would like to see some more interesting antiques, please visit the rest of my store at: \nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/Yesteryearessentials\n\n\nYou can read about me, my experience and my passion for antiques at:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/people\/Yesteryearessentials?ref=owner_profile\n\n\nFeedback from happy customers can be found at: http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/people\/yesteryearessentials\/feedback \n\n\nHave a look at my facebook page where I list new finds, upcoming sales and fun bits of antiques info.
